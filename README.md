# Fake News Detection using Logistic Regression + TF-IDF

This project builds a fake news detection model using:
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **POS Awareness (Part-of-Speech)**
- **Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)**

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Add your Kaggle API credentials in the first cell of the notebook.
3. Run the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
4. The model will:
   - Train on a dataset from Kaggle.
   - Evaluate its performance.
   - Allow you to input custom text to predict whether it’s *Real* or *Fake*.



## Model
- Saved as `fake_news_model.pkl` and `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`
- Can be reloaded for future predictions
